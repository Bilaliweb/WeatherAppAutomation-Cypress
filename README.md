# WeatherAppAutomation-Cypress
In this repo I've done few test cases for this application like searching a city and verifying the weather conditions and weather forecast.

# Get Started
1. Clone project using ```git clone```
2. Install cypress using command line ```npm i cypress```
3. To start cypress run ```npx cypress open```
4. After starting select a browser. I would prefer chrome as I use it mostly.
5. Then select a file with syntax ```.cy.js``` to run test cases.
