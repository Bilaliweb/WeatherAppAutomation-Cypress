# WeatherAppAutomation-Cypress
I've done few test cases for Open Weather application like searching a city, verifying the weather conditions and weather forecast.

# Get Started
1. Clone project using ```git clone```
2. Install packages using command line ```npm i```
3. To install cypress use command line ```npm i cypress```
4. To start cypress run ```npx cypress open```
5. After starting select a browser. I would prefer chrome as I use it mostly.
6. Then select a file with syntax ```.cy.js``` to run test cases.
7. To run on command line type ```npx cypress run``` and at the end you'll get video of test cases, screenshots (if any error occurred) and also a report in tabular form.
